# MultiPing
A tool to ping multible targets automaticly. This project is a fun project so there will be no support by me.

Buildtools:
- Lazarus 3.2
- FPC 3.2.2

Dependencies:
- Synapse
- SQLite3

Usage:
Add some targets to the list, set the interval and press start. The latest results will be diplayed in the grid. For more details inspect the log(press button, double click on target in list, press enter when grid has focus, right click target in list and click view log).
